step 1:In this program I am creating a function to import the web-3Dayforecast.xml XML data file. This function includes exceptionhandling clauses.
Using a loop structure, I am printing the values associated with each day for each station in the XML data.
  i. day_num
  ii. wind_speed
  iii. wind_dir
step 2: I am Calculating the average max_temp for across all days for stations where the id value is greater than 03956.
step 3: I am Extracting the following information from the XML weather forecast data and writing it to a CSV file:
  • Id
  • location
  • day_num
  • wind_speed
  • wind_dir
